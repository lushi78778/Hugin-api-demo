    Marrying Tampering and Fire


Triangulating prime component with 2 members:
    Report, Leaving
This component is a clique of cost 4

Triangulating prime component with 2 members:
    Smoke, Fire
This component is a clique of cost 4

Triangulating prime component with 2 members:
    Leaving, Alarm
This component is a clique of cost 4

Triangulating prime component with 3 members:
    Alarm, Fire, Tampering
This component is a clique of cost 8


Total cost of triangulation for all prime components is 20


Elimination sequence:

    Smoke
    Tampering
    Fire
    Report
    Alarm
    Leaving


Cliques:

Clique 4, 2 members, table size = 4:
    Leaving, Alarm

Clique 3, 2 members, table size = 4:
    Leaving, Report

Clique 2, 3 members, table size = 8:
    Alarm, Fire, Tampering

Clique 1, 2 members, table size = 4:
    Fire, Smoke

Total clique table size: 20


The junction forest:

Creating junction tree with clique 4 as root ...

Cliques 3 and 4 linked, separator has 1 member and table size = 2:
    Leaving

Cliques 2 and 4 linked, separator has 1 member and table size = 2:
    Alarm

Cliques 1 and 2 linked, separator has 1 member and table size = 2:
    Fire


Assignment of potentials to cliques:

    Node Report assigned to clique 3
    Node Leaving assigned to clique 4
    Node Alarm assigned to clique 2
    Node Smoke assigned to clique 1
    Node Fire assigned to clique 1
    Node Tampering assigned to clique 2
